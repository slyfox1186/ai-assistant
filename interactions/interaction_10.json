  "answer": "[Research Results]\n\nTitle: Research Result 1\nSummary: The solar system consists of eight major planets, five officially recognized dwarf planets, and a multitude of moons, asteroids, and comets. The planets are categorized into two groups based on their composition and distance from the Sun.\n\n### The Eight Major Planets\n1. **Mercury**: The closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the solar system. It has a rocky surface and experiences extreme temperature variations.\n   - Diameter: 3,031 miles (4,878 km)\n   - Orbit: 88 Earth days\n   - Moons: 0\n\n2. **Venus**: The second planet from the Sun, Venus is similar in size to Earth but has a thick, toxic atmosphere that creates a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet.\n   - Diameter: 7,521 miles (12,104 km)\n   - Orbit: 225 Earth days\n   - Moons: 0\n\n3. **Earth**: The third planet and the only one known to support life. Earth has a diverse environment, predominantly covered by water.\n   - Diameter: 7,926 miles (12,760 km)\n   - Orbit: 365.24 days\n   - Moons: 1\n\n4. **Mars**: Known as the Red Planet due to its iron oxide surface. Mars has the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system and has evidence suggesting it once had liquid water.\n   - Diameter: 4,217 miles (6,787 km)\n   - Orbit: 687 Earth days\n   - Moons: 2\n\n5. **Jupiter**: The largest planet in the solar system, a gas giant with a massive storm known as the Great Red Spot. It has a strong magnetic field and numerous moons.\n   - Diameter: 86,881 miles (139,822 km)\n   - Orbit: 11.9 Earth years\n   - Moons: 79 (53 confirmed)\n\n6. **Saturn**: Famous for its extensive ring system, Saturn is also a gas giant with a composition mainly of hydrogen and helium.\n   - Diameter: 74,900 miles (120,500 km)\n   - Orbit: 29.5 Earth years\n   - Moons: 82 (53 confirmed)\n\n7. **Uranus**: An ice giant with a unique tilt that causes extreme seasonal variations. It has a faint ring system and a blue-green color due to methane in its atmosphere.\n   - Diameter: 31,763 miles (51,120 km)\n   - Orbit: 84 Earth years\n   - Moons: 27\n\n8. **Neptune**: The eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun, Neptune is also an ice giant characterized by strong winds and storms.\n   - Diameter: 30,775 miles (49,530 km)\n   - Orbit: 165 Earth years\n   - Moons: 14\n\n### Dwarf Planets\nIn addition to the eight planets, there are five officially recognized dwarf planets:\n- **Pluto**: Once classified as the ninth planet, it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. It has a complex and elliptical orbit and is located in the Kuiper Belt.\n- **Ceres**: The only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system, situated in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.\n- **Eris, Haumea, and Makemake**: All located in the Kuiper Belt, these objects are similar to Pluto in size and composition.\n\n### Other Objects\nThe solar system is also home to:\n- Over 170 natural satellites (moons).\n- Approximately 1.4 million known asteroids, mainly located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.\n- Billions of comets, primarily found in two regions: the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud, which is thought to surround the solar system at distances between 2,000 and 100,000 astronomical units from the Sun.\n\n### Formation and Structure\nThe solar system formed around 4.5 billion years ago from a solar nebula. The Sun, containing 99% of the system's mass, exerts gravitational influence on all bodies orbiting it, which move in elliptical orbits. The solar system is located in the Orion-Cygnus Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, orbiting the galactic center every 230 million years.\n\n### Exploration\nSpace missions and telescopes have greatly enhanced our understanding of these celestial bodies, contributing to the ongoing exploration of our solar system.\n----------------------------------------\n\nTitle: Research Result 2\nSummary: The Solar System consists of eight planets and five officially recognized dwarf planets. The planets can be categorized into two groups based on their characteristics: terrestrial (rocky) planets and giant (gas and ice) planets.\n\n### Terrestrial Planets\nThe four inner planets\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars\u2014are known as terrestrial planets. They have solid surfaces composed primarily of rocks and metals. \n\n- **Mercury** is the smallest planet and closest to the Sun, with surface temperatures ranging from 280 to 430 \u00b0C.\n- **Venus**, Earth's closest neighbor, has a thick atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, leading to extreme surface temperatures of about 700 K (approximately 900 \u00b0F).\n- **Earth** is unique in supporting life, with a balanced atmosphere that allows for liquid water.\n- **Mars**, known as the red planet, has a cold, thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide and surface temperatures generally below freezing.\n\n### Giant Planets\nThe outer planets\u2014Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune\u2014are divided into gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and ice giants (Uranus and Neptune).\n\n- **Jupiter** is the largest planet in the Solar System, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with a core of heavier elements.\n- **Saturn** is known for its prominent ring system and has a similar composition to Jupiter.\n- **Uranus** and **Neptune** have smaller atmospheres relative to their cores, which are also composed of rock, metal, and ice. Uranus is unique for its extreme axial tilt, while Neptune is noted for its deep blue color and strong winds.\n\n### Dwarf Planets\nBeyond Neptune lies a group of smaller worlds known as dwarf planets. The five recognized dwarf planets are:\n\n- **Ceres**, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, is the only dwarf planet in the inner Solar System.\n- **Pluto**, once considered the ninth planet, was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n- **Haumea** is oval-shaped and known for its fast rotation.\n- **Makemake** is slightly smaller than Pluto and is the second-brightest object in the Kuiper Belt.\n- **Eris**, which is similar in size to Pluto, played a role in the debate that led to the redefinition of planetary criteria.\n\n### Exploration History\nThe exploration of the Solar System has been conducted through various missions by space agencies, notably NASA. Over 300 robotic spacecraft have been launched to study planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. Notable missions include the Mars rovers, the Voyager spacecraft, and the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n### Composition and Characteristics\nThe composition of the planets reflects their distance from the Sun and their formation history. Terrestrial planets are primarily made of silicates and metals, while gas and ice giants are dominated by hydrogen, helium, and other compounds. The internal structures vary: terrestrial planets have differentiated layers with a core, mantle, and crust, while gas giants have dense cores surrounded by layers of gas.\n\n### Summary\nThe Solar System is a diverse collection of celestial bodies with a range of characteristics. The terrestrial planets are solid and rocky, while the giant planets are gas or ice-rich. Dwarf planets, primarily found beyond Neptune, provide insights into the early Solar System. Ongoing exploration continues to enhance our understanding of these fascinating worlds.\n----------------------------------------\n\nFinal Summary:\nThe Solar System is a diverse and complex assembly of celestial bodies, primarily consisting of eight major planets, five officially recognized dwarf planets, and a vast array of moons, asteroids, and comets. \n\n### Major Planets\nThe eight major planets are divided into two categories based on their composition: terrestrial (rocky) and giant (gas and ice) planets.\n\n1. **Terrestrial Planets** (Inner Planets):\n   - **Mercury**: Closest to the Sun and the smallest planet.
