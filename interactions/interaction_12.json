After several failed attempts to secure a male heir and amid his infatuation with Anne Boleyn, Henry sought a papal annulment. However, Pope Clement VII refused to grant it, largely due to political pressures from Catherine's nephew, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor. Frustrated, Henry ultimately decided to reject papal authority, leading to the Act of Supremacy in 1534, which declared him the Supreme Head of the Church of England. This act effectively established a separate Anglican church, severing ties with Rome and creating a significant divide between Catholics and Protestants in England.\n\nThe dissolution of the monasteries followed, where Henry seized monastic lands and wealth, enriching the Crown and using the proceeds to fund military endeavors and alleviate debt. This move not only increased his power but also reshaped the religious landscape of England, diminishing the influence of the Catholic Church.\n\nHenry's marital history, which included six wives, was also indicative of his reign\u2019s turbulence.
